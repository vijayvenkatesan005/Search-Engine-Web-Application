It's natural,'' said Robert Friedman, the senior vice\\npresident of worldwide advertising and publicity at Warner Bros.\\n   Chris Gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``Mississippi\\nBurning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and\\nothers to express their feelings about the decade.\\n   ``Distance is important,'' he said. ``I believe there's a lot of\\nthinking about that time and America in general.''\\n   The Vietnam War was a defining experience for many people in the\\n'60s, shattering the consensus that the United States had a right,\\neven a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. Even\\ntoday, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``Vietnam Syndrome'' in\\nreferring to the country's reluctance to use military force to\\nsettle disputes.\\n   ``I think future historians will talk about Vietnam as one of the\\nnear destructions of American society,'' said Urie Brofenbrenner, a\\nprofessor of sociology at Cornell University.\\n   ``In World War II, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in\\nVietnam.''\\n   ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Good\\nMorning, Vietnam,'' ``Hamburger Hill'' and ``Bat 21'' all use the\\nwar as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.\\n   The Vietnam War has remained an emotional issue in the United\\nStates as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their\\nexperiences. One was Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the\\nAcademy Award-winning ``Platoon.''\\n   ``I saw `Platoon' eight times,'' said John J. Anderson, a Palm\\nBeach County sheriff's lieutenant who served in Vietnam in 1966-67.\\n``I cried the first time I saw it ... and the third and fourth\\ntimes. `Platoon' helped me understand.''\\n   Stone, who based ``Platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a\\ngrunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.\\n   ``People are responding to the fact that it's real. They're\\ncurious about the war in Vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.\\n   While Southeast Asia was the pivotal foreign issue in American\\nsociety of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. The\\ncivil rights movement reached its peak in the ``Freedom Summer'' of\\n1964, when large groups of volunteers headed South to help register\\nblack voters.\\n   In ``Five Corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the Bronx\\nstarring Jodie Foster, her friend, played by Tim Robbins, leaves his\\nneighborhood to volunteer in the South after seeing the Rev. Martin\\nLuther King Jr. on television.\\n   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' focuses on an incident that\\nclouded the Mississippi Summer Project _ when 1,000 young volunteers\\nfrom mainstream America swept into the state to help register black\\nvoters. The movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance\\nand slaying of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner, Andrew\\nGoodman and James Chaney.\\n   They were reported missing on June 21, several hours after being\\nstopped for speeding near Philadelphia, Miss. After a nationally\\npublicized search, their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm\\njust outside the town.\\n   One of those who recalled the incident was Gerolmo, a student in\\nthe New York public school system at the time. The screenwriter said\\nthe incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.\\n   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could\\nbe wrong,'' Gerolmo said.\\n   The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents\\nwho try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome\\nfierce local resistance to solve the crime.\\n   In a more offbeat and outrageous way, John Waters' ``Hairspray''\\ndiscusses integration in Baltimore in 1963 when a group of\\nteen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance\\nshow.\\n   Also set in Baltimore is Barry Levinson's ``Tin Men,'' starring\\nDanny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding\\nsalesmen in the early '60s. The movie mirrored a squarely\\nmiddle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics\\nand drugs.\\n   Instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,\\nwriter-director Ernest Thompson takes a more personal approach in\\n``1969.'' Robert Downey Jr. and Keifer Sutherland star as college\\nstudents who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and\\nthe Vietnam War.\\n   ``I was 19 in 1969. It was a fulcrum time for me,'' said\\nThompson, who was a student at American University at the time. ``I\\nthink it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a\\nman to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''\\n   ``Running on Empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are\\nmuch in evidence. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play anti-war\\nactivists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to\\nlive underground with their two children.\\n   Naomi Foner, who wrote ``Running on Empty'' and also served as\\nthe film's executive producer, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the\\ndaughter of sociologists. Her own experiences made Foner well\\nqualified to give ``Running on Empty'' its strong political theme.\\n   ``I lived through that time and I've wanted to find the right way\\nto present it to this generation,'' said Foner, a member of the\\nradical Students for a Democratic Society while attending graduate\\nschool at Columbia University.\\n   Foner, who also taught in Harlem's Head Start program and helped\\nregister voters in South Carolina, said many young people are\\ncurious about what happened in the '60s.\\n   ``A lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were\\nsorry to have missed,'' she said.\\n   Brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of\\nthe general public: ``The principle impact of the media is that they\\nreflect the values of the larger society.\\n   ``Film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``I believe it\\nvery accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming\\ntrends.
